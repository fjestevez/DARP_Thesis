  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has many successful applications like forest fire detection, military area protection, and so on. Sensors need to be in active mode up to the completion of the task or as long as possible. One method to increase the lifetime of sensor network is by reducing the sensing range of each sensor as required and partitioning these sensors into subsets of sensor covers such that each sensor cover can cover entire targets. Activating these sensor covers one after another will maximize the lifetime of sensor network. Identifying maximum number of sensor covers is modeled as Sensor Cover with Adjustable Sensing Range (SC-ASR). Memetic algorithm is proposed to identify the maximum number of sensor covers with adjustable sensing ranges. Simulation results on various test problems confirm that memetic algorithm significantly outperforms to maximize the network lifetime.}

  abstract = {The choice of a routing protocol in a wireless sensor network (WSN) depends on the nature of the application and on its primary mission. Lot of works addressed the problem of routing mechanisms with more or less effectiveness, some of which pointed out the use of the link quality indicator (LQI) as a route selection criterion (metric). In a previous work, following an experimental study, we have shown , under some conditions, the inefficiency of the LQI based routing. In this paper, we propose a simple way, to improve reliability and efficiency of the LQI based routing in WSN. We also evaluate other route selection criteria including the "remaining energy level" and the "sensor proximity with respect to the Base Station (BS)". The proposed local load balancing routing protocol is aimed to help source nodes to exploit potential capabilities of their respective neighbors without having any knowledge of their properties such as the position or the energy level. Simulation results show that our adaptation of the LQI metric is among the best route selection criteria regardless of the performance criterion under consideration, and that the load balancing significantly improves the routing efficiency by lengthening the network lifetime while minimizing packet losses.},

The future smart grid infrastructure is emerging as a complex system where fine-grained monitoring and control of energy generating and/or consuming entities within the electricity network is possible.

A simulation of a dynamic ecosystem such as the smart city, will enable us to test new concepts and resource-optimization approaches. Therefore we have analyzed, designed, and build a simulator based on software agents that attempts to create the dynamic behavior of a smart city. It simulates discrete heterogeneous devices that consume and/or produce energy, that are able to act autonomously and collaborate. The behavior of these devices and their groupings e.g. smart houses, has been modeled in order to map as near as possible the real behavior patterns of the respective physical objects.},

It has been created with the simulation of communication networks, multiprocessors and other distributed systems in mind as application area, but instead of building a specialized simulator, OMNeT++ was designed to be as general as possible. Since then, the idea has proven to work, and OMNeT++ has been used in numerous domains from queuing network simulations to wireless and ad-hoc network simulations, from business process simulation to peer-to-peer network, optical switch and storage area network simulations. This paper presents an overview of the OMNeT++ framework, recent challenges brought about by the growing amount and complexity of third party simulation models, and the solutions we introduce in the next major revision of the simulation framework.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of micro-sensor and radio technology, wireless sensor networks are deployed in various applications. In a continuous monitoring application, sensors gather information and transmit the sensed data to base station in a periodic manner. In each data gathering round, a node generates a data packet and transmits the packet to base station, or any other node; the data packets received from neighbouring nodes can be aggregated. The lifetime of such sensor system is the time until base station receives data from all sensors in the network. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based multi-hop routing for a homogeneous network to maximize the network lifetime. Given the location of the sensor nodes and base station, our algorithm generates a sequence of routing paths that maximizes the system lifetime},

  booktitle = {Proceedings of Global telecommunications conference (GLOBECOM)},
  year = {2008},
  month = 12,
  abstract = {We address the maximum lifetime routing problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and propose two online routing algorithms based on fuzzy logic, namely fuzzy maximum lifetime algorithm and fuzzy multiobjective algorithm. The former attempts to maximize the WSN lifetime objective, whereas the latter strives to simultaneously optimize the lifetime as well as the energy consumption objectives. The distinguishing aspect of this work is the novel use of fuzzy membership functions and rules in the design of cost functions for the routing objectives considered in this work. A range of simulation results obtained under various network scenarios show that the proposed approach is superior to a number of other well-known online routing heuristics, both in terms of the obtained network lifetime as well as the average energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Public utilities services (gas, water and electricity) have been traditionally automated with several technologies. The main functions that these technologies must support are AMR, automated meter reading, and SCADA, supervisory control and data acquisition. Most meter manufacturers provide devices with Bluetoothreg or ZigBeetrade communication features. This characteristic has allowed the inclusion of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in these systems. Once WSNs have appeared in such a scenario, real-time AMR and SCADA applications can be developed with low cost. Data must be routed from every meter to a base station. This paper describes the use of a novel QoS-driven routing algorithm, named SIR: sensor intelligence routing, over a network of meters. An artificial neural network is introduced in every node to manage the routes that data have to follow. The resulting system is named intelligent wireless sensor network (IWSN).},
